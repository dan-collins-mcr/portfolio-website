    <!-- CS PROJECT -->
    <div>
      <!-- The project -->
      <div>
        <div>
          <h2>The project</h2>
          <p>This project formed the core part of my UX Immersion course with CareerFoundry. As the sole designer, I was responsible for the entire design process, from research to a high-fidelity prototype.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- The problem -->
      <div>
        <div>
          <h2>The problem</h2>
          <p>People looking to change careers need a way to connect with professionals to explore their options and make sure they're making the right choice before committing to such a significant life change.
          </p>
          <p>We will know this to be true when we see a thriving community booking calls with professionals.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- The process -->
      <div>
        <div>
          <h2>The process</h2>
          <p>I approached this project following the design thinking method – an iterative process that seeks to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems to identify successful solutions.

      <!-- Discover -->
      <div>
        <div>
          <h2>Discover</h2>
          <p>To kick off this project, I explored a broad range of competitors in the career and expertise sectors. Following this, I conducted surveys and interviews to obtain a better understanding of users general behaviours, motivations, and
            experiences towards changing careers.

          <h2>Define</h2>
          <p>Following my research, I synthesised my findings and created personas and user journeys to better empathise with my main user groups. These exercises formed a great foundation to move into feature ideation.

        <div>
          <h2>Ideate & prototype</h2>
          <p>After having establishing personas and user journeys, I started to sketch out my ideas, so I can easily experiment with different layouts and ideas. I focused on highlighting the core features and created multiple versions of each screen
            until I found a good combination of features and elements that matched the user’s needs.

          <p>To test CareerSteer’s basic functions, flow logic and Identify any potential blockers to completing tasks (searching for mentors, booking a call and completing a call).
          </p>
          <p>The study was moderated and done remotely using Zoom, testing the mid-fidelity prototype created with Figma.

          <h2>The final product</h2>
          <p>After nearly 6 months of work; researching, prototyping, testing and iterating, I finally had a viable product. With the core features, established users can easily search and book a call with an experienced mentor.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div>
        <div>
          <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
          <p>This project has taught me the value of empathising with users and testing assumptions. Following the design thinking process was time-consuming but worth it, proving essential to the success of the final iteration of the design.</p>
          <h3>How was I challenged?</h3>
          <p>Taking the time to empathise with users genuinely enhanced the final product beyond what I could have achieved alone. For example, I’d attempted to keep the design simple by placing the filter icon within the search bar and excluding
            a
            label. However, user testing highlighted that I’d actually introduced a lack of clarity as to the icon’s meaning. The reworked design wasn’t necessarily as clean as the first iteration but was much more successful in allowing the user
            to filter search results. The lesson learnt is that simplicity in design, although very important, isn’t the ultimate goal nor should come at the expense of a user’s ability to achieve their goal.</p>
          <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
          <p>I would like to refine the onboarding process for new users by adding appropriately timed coach marks as they start using the different features. I would also like to create a high-fidelity desktop version of the application to
            ensure
            that everything works consistently across all formats.</p>
          <h3>What next?</h3>
          <p>I feel I’ve only just scratched the surface of what is possible for CareerSteer. I would like to continue to follow the Build – Measure – Learn design cycle, refining the existing functionality and developing new features.
          </p>
          <p>I would like to conduct further user testing using evaluative research methods such as eye-tracking, field studies, diary studies and A/B testing to understand how well the app is achieving its goals and identify which features could
            be
            further improved.
